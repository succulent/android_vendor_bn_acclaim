Hello all,

Credits:
Bauwks for his exploit in 2nd boot.
Team B+ (Goncezilla, CelticWebs, Indirect) for furthering Nook Tablet development.
WhistleStop and JackpotClavin from Kindle Fire development for the device and vendor source.
Fattire, Nemith, and Dalingrin for CWM, and works on Nook Color and Nook Tablet development.
XDA for home to many great developers.

My source is primary based on Whistlestop source, but Iâ€™ve used bits and pieces from other sources (P920, and Targa).

My goal was to build CM7 for nook Tablet as a learning experience. I've always used rom created by other people. I find that building your own rom was more satisfying and I think everyone should try it at least once. It will require some time and some learning, but it will be special in the end.
